IDEAS
=====



TASKS
=====

- VAR, GET, SET - analog of scoped variables


- implement 'AND' method for parallel running tasks, and single exit point (?)
    - how to handle CATCH/THROW for them then?
    
- allow JooseX.CPS.Statement instances as parameters to TRY, THEN, CATCH and FINALLLY
 


DONE
====

- global CONT instead of scoped? (no attach then, only detach)
- clear CONT after returning from the continued method
- keep the intuitively expected scope during continued method calls (fixed?)
- create Task/ package to speedup the loading



GARBAGE
=======

- do not remove CONT/RESULT after exiting the scope to slightly improve the performance?
- test the 'detachScope' method
- RETURN from inside of CATCH scope (was a bug in Symbie, not related directly)
